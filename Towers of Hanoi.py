# Towers of Hanoi
# Move all disks from stack 1 to stack 3
# Only one disk can be moved at a time.
# Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack. In other words, a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
# No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk
#
# This is the list of moves that always leads to success
