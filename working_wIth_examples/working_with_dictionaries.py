#  Examples of how to use a dictionary in Python
#  Dictionaries are defined with key:value pairs (note comma)
#  Keys can be integers or strings
test_dict = {
    1: "one",
    2: "two",
    3: "three"
}
# We retrieve items from a dictionary using the dictionary
# name and specifying a key
print("*** Return the value with the key of 2")
print(test_dict[2])

# iterating through a dict with a loop
print("Iterate through specific items in a dictionary  with a loop")
for i in range(1, 3):  # start at 1 stop before 3
    print(test_dict[i])

# Methods used with Dictionaries
test_dict[1] = "REPLACED" # Replace the value with the key of 1
print("*** Return a List of all the values in a dictionary")
print(test_dict.values())

# Find the length of the dictionary (number of key:item pairs)
dict_length = len(test_dict.values())
print(f"*** The length of the dictionary is {dict_length} items")
print("*** Use the get method for another way to return a value with a key")
print(test_dict.get(2))
# How would you make a dictionary of class members with
# email address(as the key), last name  first name and email address?

}

print(ITN1_class["fgluck@sanford.org"]) #Show the name of the person who owns the email

# Make a dictionary for a game that has a backpack. Use a dictionary of lists

}
# This list will allow you to figure out the points for each item in the backpack
points = {
